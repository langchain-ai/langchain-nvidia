# NVIDIA

The `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints` package contains LangChain integrations for chat models and embeddings powered by [NVIDIA AI Foundation Models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/), and hosted on the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/).

NVIDIA AI Foundation models are community- and NVIDIA-built models that are optimized to deliver the best performance on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure. 
You can use the API to query live endpoints that are available on the NVIDIA API Catalog to get quick results from a DGX-hosted cloud compute environment, 
or you can download models from NVIDIA's API catalog with NVIDIA NIM, which is included with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise license. 
The ability to run models on-premises gives your enterprise ownership of your customizations and full control of your IP and AI application. 

NIM microservices are packaged as container images on a per model/model family basis 
and are distributed as NGC container images through the [NVIDIA NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/). 
At their core, NIM microservices are containers that provide interactive APIs for running inference on an AI Model. 

Use this documentation to learn how to install the `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints` package 
and use it for some common functionality for text-generative and embedding models.



## Install the Package

```python
pip install -U --quiet langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints
```



## Access the NVIDIA API Catalog

To get access to the NVIDIA API Catalog, do the following:

1. Create a free account on the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/) and log in.
2. Click your profile icon, and then click **API Keys**. The **API Keys** page appears.
3. Click **Generate API Key**. The **Generate API Key** window appears.
4. Click **Generate Key**. You should see **API Key Granted**, and your key appears.
5. Copy and save the key as `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.
6. To verify your key, use the following code.

   ```python
   import getpass
   import os

   if os.environ.get("NVIDIA_API_KEY", "").startswith("nvapi-"):
       print("Valid NVIDIA_API_KEY already in environment. Delete to reset")
   else:
       nvapi_key = getpass.getpass("NVAPI Key (starts with nvapi-): ")
       assert nvapi_key.startswith(
           "nvapi-"
       ), f"{nvapi_key[:5]}... is not a valid key"
       os.environ["NVIDIA_API_KEY"] = nvapi_key
   ```

You can now use your key to access endpoints on the NVIDIA API Catalog.



## Work with the API Catalog

The following example chats with MistralAI's model [Mixtral 8x22B](https://build.nvidia.com/mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct/modelcard) 
hosted on the NVIDIA API Catalog.

```python
from langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct-v0.1")
result = llm.invoke("Write a ballad about LangChain.")
print(result.content)
```



## Self-host with NVIDIA NIM Microservices

When you are ready to deploy your AI application, you can self-host models with NVIDIA NIM. 
For more information, refer to [NVIDIA NIM Microservices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nim-microservices/).

The following code connects to locally hosted NIM Microservices.

```python
from langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints import ChatNVIDIA, NVIDIAEmbeddings, NVIDIARerank

# connect to an chat NIM running at localhost:8000, specifyig a specific model
llm = ChatNVIDIA(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", model="meta/llama3-8b-instruct")

# connect to an embedding NIM running at localhost:8080
embedder = NVIDIAEmbeddings(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1")

# connect to a reranking NIM running at localhost:2016
ranker = NVIDIARerank(base_url="http://localhost:2016/v1")
```



## Use NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints

A selection of [NVIDIA AI Foundation Models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/) are supported directly in LangChain with familiar APIs. 
The following notebooks can help you get started:
